# Python_Poker

A little poker game I'm working on

## Installation

Simply clone the repo, then create a python virtual environement.

Use the requirements.txt file to install the dependencies (only pygame here)

Enjoy !

## Sources

I took the cards images from this BlackJack game made by Allan Lavell (flummoxed).
